## Introduction

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes various techniques and tools to extract insights and knowledge from data. This toolkit provides notebooks and a project example to help you explore different aspects of data science using Python and Power BI.

## Notebooks

### NumPy Notebook

The NumPy notebook provides an introduction to the fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It covers basic array operations, mathematical functions, and array manipulation techniques using NumPy.

### Data Visualization Notebook

The Data Visualization notebook showcases techniques for creating insightful visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. It covers different types of plots and charts to effectively communicate data insights.

### Pandas Notebook

The Pandas notebook demonstrates data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. It includes topics such as data cleaning, manipulation, aggregation, and merging datasets.

### Core Python Codes Notebook

The Core Python Codes notebook contains essential Python programming examples and techniques relevant to data science. It covers topics such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and file handling.

### Scikit-learn Notebook

The Scikit-learn notebook provides examples of machine learning algorithms implemented using the Scikit-learn library. It covers techniques for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.

## Project

### Cricket Data Analysis Project

The Cricket Data Analysis project is a practical example demonstrating the application of data science techniques to analyze cricket match data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models to predict match outcomes or player performance.

## Power BI Project

The Power BI project (`.pbix` file) contains a cricket data analysis dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. It visualizes insights derived from the Cricket Data Analysis project, offering interactive and dynamic visualizations for better understanding and decision-making.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks and project in this repository to enhance your understanding of data science concepts and techniques. You can run the notebooks locally in your preferred Python environment and open the Power BI project using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
